# Virtual_Painter
A **Virtual Painter** in which you can draw shapes and erase without even touching your device!
_Make a virtual painter using python programming language. It will work like a touch screen and allow you to draw just by dragging your finger infront of your web cam! Easy right! Just like we see in movies._
For this, I have used the following libraries: 
1. **Mediapipe** 
2. **cv2**
3. **Numpy**
4. **Time**.
## Features of this application:
1. Draw lines
2. Draw rectangles
3. Draw with finger
4. Draw circles
5. Erase

I have used **Mediapipe's Solution** for Hand Landmark Detection.

## How to use:
Using this app is very simple just select any tool from top by your index finger keep hand there until you see text is changed and now you use this by raising your both index and middle finger at once.
you can alter tool by just following same steps.
